`# Image Encryption Tool

## Overview

The **Image Encryption Tool** is a Python-based application that securely encrypts image files by manipulating pixel values. This tool aims to enhance data privacy and security for visual data, ensuring that images are unrecognizable without the correct decryption key.

## Features

- **Pixel Manipulation**: Encrypts images by altering the RGB values of individual pixels.
- **Confidentiality**: Prevents unauthorized access to images, making them secure for transmission or storage.
- **Format Support**: Compatible with various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use interface for encrypting and decrypting images.

## Installation

To set up the Image Encryption Tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jagdishtripathy/Image-Encryption-tool.git `

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `cd Image-Encryption-tool`

2.  **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed. You may need additional libraries such as Pillow for image processing. You can install them using:

    bash

    Copy code

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Usage
-----

1.  **Encrypting an Image**:

    -   Run the script to encrypt an image:

        bash

        Copy code

        `python encrypt.py input_image.jpg output_image.enc`

2.  **Decrypting an Image**:

    -   To decrypt the encrypted image:

        bash

        Copy code

        `python decrypt.py output_image.enc decrypted_image.jpg`
